    In astronomy, dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that appears not to interact with light or the
    electromagnetic field. Dark matter is implied by gravitational effects which cannot be explained by general
    relativity unless more matter is present than can be seen. Such effects occur in the context of formation and
    evolution of galaxies,[1] gravitational lensing,[2] the observable universe's current structure, mass position in
    galactic collisions,[3] the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters, and cosmic microwave background anisotropies
