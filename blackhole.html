    A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other
    electromagnetic waves, is capable of possessing enough energy to escape it.[2] Einstein's theory of general
    relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[3][4] The boundary
    of no escape is called the event horizon. A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object
    crossing it, but it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.[5] In many ways, a black
    hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[6][7] Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts
    that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely
    proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making
    it essentially impossible to observe directly
