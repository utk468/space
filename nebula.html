    A nebula (Latin for 'cloud, fog';[1] pl.: nebulae, nebul√¶, or nebulas[2][3][4][5]) is a distinct luminescent part of
    interstellar medium, which can consist of ionized, neutral, or molecular hydrogen and also cosmic dust. Nebulae are
    often star-forming regions, such as in the "Pillars of Creation" in the Eagle Nebula. In these regions, the
    formations of gas, dust, and other materials "clump" together to form denser regions, which attract further matter
    and eventually become dense enough to form stars. The remaining material is then thought to form planets and other
    planetary system objects.
