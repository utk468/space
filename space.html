Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.<br>[1] In classical physics, physical space
is often conceived in three linear dimensions.<br> Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a
boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.[2]<br> The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental
importance to an understanding of the physical universe.<br> However, disagreement continues between philosophers over
whether <br>it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.
